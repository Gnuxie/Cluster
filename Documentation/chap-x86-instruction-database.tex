\chapter{X86 instruction database}

\sysname{} contains a database with the description of a significant
number of instructions.  Each instruction is described by one or more
occurrences of calls to the macro \texttt{define-instruction}
described below.  A set of calls is recognized as containing different
variations on the same instruction by the fact that the required
parameter \texttt{mnemonic} is the same string for each member of the
set.

\defmacro define-instruction {mnemonic \key 
				       modes
				       operands
				       opcodes
				       opcode-extension
				       encoding
				       lock
				       operand-size-override
				       rex.w}
